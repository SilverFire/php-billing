Billing library providing:

- customers with subscriptions
- orders with actions
- tariff plans with prices
- bills with charges
- calculator and aggregator

- one-time, metered and recurring charging

Please see [additional doccumentation in russian](docs/ru.md).

## Installation

The preferred way to install this library is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```sh
php composer.phar require "hiqdev/php-billing"
```

or add

```json
"hiqdev/php-billing": "*"
```

to the require section of your composer.json.

## Idea

In general the billing functions like this:

For a given [order] a [calculator] finds [plan]s and then matches
applicable [price]s to [action]s and calculates [charge]s.
Then [charge]s can be aggregated to [bill]s with [aggregator].

Billing operates such ideas:

- [Action] - [customer]'s action of a [type] to a [target]
- [Order] - collection of [action]s
- [Charge]
- [Bill]
- [Plan]
- [Price]
- [Customer]
- [Sale] - binds [customer] to [target] and [plan]
- [Target] - object being charged in billing
- [Type]
- [Calculator]
- [Aggregator]
